Based on the DOE analysis, here are recommendations for method selection:

USE PCReg_CV when:
  - Sample Size (n lots) = 5 (win rate: 61%)
  - Error Magnitude (CV) = 0.01 (win rate: 71%)

OLS is competitive when:
  - Sample Size (n lots) = 30 (PCReg win rate: 51%)
  - Feature Correlation = 0.5 (PCReg win rate: 55%)
  - Error Magnitude (CV) = 0.1 (PCReg win rate: 52%)
  - Error Magnitude (CV) = 0.2 (PCReg win rate: 47%)

KEY FACTORS affecting method performance:

GENERAL GUIDANCE:
  - PCReg benefits most from incorporating prior knowledge via constraints
  - With small samples (n < 10), constraints become more valuable
  - PCReg_CV_Tight (well-specified constraints) is optimal when bounds are known
  - PCReg_CV_Wrong shows robustness to constraint misspecification
