  Small datasets with multicollinearity pose serious challenges to the stability
  of coefficients generated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. A motivating
  example in cost estimating is Cost Improvement Curve with Rate Effect analysis,
  where datasets are typically small, the lot midpoint (Learning) is correlated to
  lot size (Rate) as production ramps up, and slopes are expected to be negative.
  This paper presents Penalized-Constrained Regression (PCReg), a method that
  combines elastic net regularization with domain-knowledge constraints for
  improved learning curve estimation. Through a comprehensive Monte Carlo
  simulation study with 6,075 scenario-replications, we demonstrate that PCReg
  outperforms OLS in 58% of scenarios, with particular advantages when data quality
  is high, sample sizes are small, or when OLS produces coefficients with incorrect signs.

# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip title="Key Findings"}
**Problem**: Small datasets with correlated predictors cause OLS to produce unstable, often nonsensical coefficient estimates (wrong signs, implausible magnitudes).

**Solution**: Penalized-Constrained Regression (PCReg) combines elastic net regularization with bound constraints based on domain knowledge.

**Results**: In our Monte Carlo study (243 scenarios x 25 replications = 6,075 total):

- **Overall**: PCReg wins 58% of scenarios vs OLS
- **When OLS has wrong signs**: PCReg wins 81% of scenarios
- **High-quality data** (CV error = 0.01): PCReg wins 67-75%
- **Small samples** (n = 5): PCReg wins 64%

**Recommendation**: Use PCReg when sample size is small (n ≤ 10) or data quality is high (CV error ≤ 0.10). Use OLS when sample size is large (n ≥ 30) and noise is high (CV error = 0.20).
