    "\n",
    "This appendix summarizes key research papers supporting the methodology presented in this paper. Papers are ordered by direct applicability to the research objectives: addressing multicollinearity in small datasets, imposing prior knowledge through constraints, and assessing model fit using likelihood-free diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A.1 Penalized and Constrained LAD Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors**: Wu, Liang, Yang (2022) \\| **Source**: Statistical Papers \\| **Relevance**: Most directly applicable\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper proposes L1 penalized Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) estimation with linear constraints (pcLAD). Unlike constrained Lasso which uses squared error loss, pcLAD uses absolute deviation loss, making it robust to heavy-tailed errors and outliers. The method supports both equality constraints ($C\\beta = b$) and inequality constraints ($C\\beta \\leq b$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Contributions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Proves Oracle property for the constrained estimator in fixed dimensions\n",
    "-   For high-dimensional settings ($p >> n$), derives error bounds showing estimation error is $O(\\sqrt{\\max(m, k-m)\\log(p)/n})$, where $m$ is constraints and $k$ is non-zero coefficients\n",
    "-   Demonstrates that adding constraints can sharpen estimation bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application to Cost Estimation**: Non-negative lasso variant is relevant for cost estimation where coefficients must be positive. Monotonic order estimation supports learning curve constraints. Robustness to heavy-tailed errors addresses outliers common in cost data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A.2 Algorithms for Fitting the Constrained Lasso\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors**: Gaines, Kim, Zhou (2018) \\| **Source**: J. Comp. & Graph. Statistics \\| **Relevance**: Highly applicable\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides three computational approaches for constrained Lasso: Quadratic Programming (QP), ADMM, and a novel solution path algorithm. The constrained Lasso augments standard Lasso with linear equality and inequality constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Contributions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Demonstrates generalized Lasso can be transformed into constrained Lasso\n",
    "-   Derives degrees of freedom formula: $\\text{df} = |\\text{Active predictors}| - (\\text{\\# equality constraints}) - (\\text{\\# binding inequality constraints})$\n",
    "-   Enables proper model selection criteria (AIC, BIC) for constrained models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application to Cost Estimation**: Non-negativity constraints (positive Lasso) support cost estimation requirements. Monotonic ordering constraints (ordered Lasso) support learning curve slope constraints. Solution path algorithm enables efficient cross-validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Authors**: James, Paulson, Rusmevichientong (2020) \\| **Source**: JASA \\| **Relevance**: Highly applicable\n",
    "\n",
    "PAC extends constrained optimization beyond squared error loss to general loss functions $g(\\beta)$, including generalized linear models. The formulation minimizes $g(\\beta) + \\lambda\\|\\beta\\|_1$ subject to $C\\beta \\leq b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Contributions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Shows generalized Lasso is a special case of constrained problem\n",
    "-   Develops efficient path algorithm reducing constrained optimization to sequence of standard Lasso problems\n",
    "-   Demonstrates that even when constraints are approximately (not exactly) satisfied, PAC outperforms unconstrained methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application to Cost Estimation**: Monotone curve fitting directly supports learning curve estimation. Robustness to constraint violations is realistic for cost estimation where prior knowledge is informative but not perfect.\n",

    "## A.4 Multicollinearity in CER Development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors**: Flynn & James (2016) \\| **Source**: ICEAA Workshop \\| **Relevance**: Directly applicable to problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides comprehensive treatment of multicollinearity diagnosis and remediation specifically for defense cost analysis. Demonstrates classic symptoms: wrong coefficient signs, bouncing β’s, mismatch between t and F statistics, inflated variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Contributions**:\n",

    "**Authors**: Hu & Smith (2007) \\| **Source**: SCEA-ISPA \\| **Relevance**: Background on constrained CER methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Compares MUPE (IRLS) and ZMPE for multiplicative error models. MUPE is unconstrained and produces BLUE estimates. ZMPE uses zero-percentage-bias constraint but has unclear statistical properties.\n",

    "## Synthesis: Recommendations for Implementation\n",
