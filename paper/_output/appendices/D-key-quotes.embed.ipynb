    "This appendix compiles key quotes from the literature that support the methodology and findings presented in this paper. These quotes may be useful for presentations, discussions, and future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## D.1 On Multicollinearity Severity\n",
    "\n",
    "> “The statistical literature regards multicollinearity as one of the most vexing and intractable problems in all of regression analysis.” — @flynn2016multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "## D.2 On Coefficient Instability\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Generate unstable models where small changes in the data produce big changes in parameter estimates \\[bouncing β’s\\].” — @flynn2016multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "## D.3 On GDF Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "> “ZMPE users do not adjust the degrees of freedom (DF) to account for constraints included in the regression process. As a result, fit statistics for the ZMPE equations, e.g., the standard percent error (SPE) and generalized R² (GRSQ), can be incorrect and misleading.” — @hu2010gdf\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Using ZMPE CERs in cost uncertainty analysis may unduly tighten the S-curve because their SPEs underestimate the CER error distribution.” — @hu2010gdf\n",
    "\n",
    "## D.4 On Robustness to Imperfect Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "> “The results suggest that PAC and relaxed PAC are surprisingly robust to random violations in the constraints. While both methods deteriorated slightly as \\[constraint error\\] increased, they were still both superior to their unconstrained counterparts for all values of \\[error\\] and all settings.” — @james2020pac\n",
    "\n",
    "## D.5 On Constrained Lasso Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "> “The constrained lasso is a very flexible framework for imposing additional knowledge and structure onto the lasso coefficient estimates.” — @gaines2018constrained\n",
    "\n",
    "## D.6 On pcLAD with Heavy-Tailed Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "> “pcLAD enjoys the Oracle property even with Cauchy-distributed errors… particularly effective for monotone curve fitting and non-negative constraints.” — @wu2022pclad\n",
    "\n",
    "## D.7 On Ridge Regression Optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "The Theobald-Farebrother theorem establishes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> For any OLS problem, there exists a ridge parameter $\\lambda^* > 0$ such that the ridge estimator has strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) than OLS. — @theobald1974; @farebrother1976\n",
    "\n",
    "## D.8 On Bayesian Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Bayesian interpolation using a spherical Gaussian prior $p(w|\\lambda) = N(w|0, \\lambda^{-1}I)$ iteratively maximizes marginal log-likelihood to optimize regularization parameters.” — @mackay1992bayesian\n",
    "\n",
    "## D.9 Key Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Oracle Property\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimator has the **Oracle property** if it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Correctly identifies which coefficients are truly zero (variable selection consistency)\n",
    "2.  Estimates non-zero coefficients as efficiently as if an “oracle” revealed the true model in advance\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the gold standard for high-dimensional estimators—the Lasso achieves it under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cauchy-Distributed Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Cauchy distribution** has extremely heavy tails—so heavy that its mean and variance are mathematically undefined (infinite). Outliers occur far more frequently than with normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Squared-error methods (OLS, Ridge, Lasso) perform poorly with Cauchy errors because outliers dominate the objective\n",
    "-   LAD methods minimize absolute errors, so outliers have linear rather than quadratic influence—making them robust to such extremes\n",
    "\n",
    "### BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the **Gauss-Markov theorem**, OLS is the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator under classical assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Linear in the parameters\n",
    "-   Unbiased: $E[\\hat{\\beta}] = \\beta$\n",
    "-   Minimum variance among all linear unbiased estimators\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing penalties and/or constraints means the resulting estimator is **no longer BLUE**. This is an intentional tradeoff accepting bias for reduced variance.\n",
